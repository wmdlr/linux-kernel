	---help---
	  If you have a Baikal Electronics SoC with network (Ethernet)
	  controller say Y.

	  Note that the answer to this question does not directly affect
	  the kernel: saying N will just case the configurator to skip all
	  the questions regarding Baikal SoCs. If you say Y, you will be asked
	  for your specific driver in the following questions.

if NET_VENDOR_BAIKAL

config BAIKAL_XGBE
	tristate "Baikal 10GbE Ethernet driver"
	depends on OF_NET && HAS_IOMEM
	select PHYLIB
	select BITREVERSE
	select CRC32
	select PTP_1588_CLOCK
	---help---
	  This driver supports the Baikal 10GbE Ethernet device found on an
	  Baikal SoC.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the module
	  will be called baikal-xgbe.
